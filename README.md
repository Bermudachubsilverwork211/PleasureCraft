## Key Features & Mechanics

* **Relationship Points:** This is the core of the mod.  Players earn Relationship Points (RP) by:
    * **Touching:**  Touch a partner (either directly or through a shared object like a flower or a piece of furniture) to gain 1 RP.
    * **Creating Scents:**  Craft a scent using specific ingredients (flowers, herbs, wood, etc.) and place it near a partner to earn 2 RP.  This adds a visual and olfactory element to the gameplay.
    * **Building Structures:**  Construct a small, simple structure (like a shrine or a small hut) near a partner to earn 3 RP.
* **Vibe System:**  A dynamic system that influences RP gain based on the environment and the mood of the players.  This uses a combination of:
    * **Lighting:**  Darker lighting yields more RP.
    * **Music:**  Music plays a crucial role in mood and RP.
    * **Environment:**  Certain environments (forests, meadows, etc.) provide bonuses.
* **Shadows:**  Shadows are crucial for creating a sense of mystery and intimacy.  Players can use specific blocks (like a moonstone) to cast shadows on each other.
* **Gesture System:**  Players can use a limited range of gestures to express affection and build connection.  This is a small, but impactful, mechanic.
* **Optional Event System:**  Introducing limited-time events tied to romantic themes and gameplay.
